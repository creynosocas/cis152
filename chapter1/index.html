    <p> My favorite beverage is kombucha. It's healthy, fizzy and it comes with a lot of probiotics that aids digestion. I started drinking kombucha two years ago, and I remember not being a big fan of it because of its strong flavorm, but now I love it. It is basically a fermented tea with probiotics, antioxidants and polyphenols that also helps with inflammation. It comes in many flavors and brands, and my favorite is from  Brew Dr.
